This project focuses on analyzing YouTube channel performance using various metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement rates. By leveraging the YouTube API, we aim to provide insights that can help content creators and marketers optimize their strategies.

## Project Goals
1. Collect and analyze channel metadata and video performance data.
2. Visualize trends in subscriber growth, views, and engagement metrics.
3. Provide actionable insights for improving content strategy and audience engagement.
4. Generate comprehensive reports summarizing channel performance.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - i) Channel Overview
   - ii) Video Performance Metrics
4. **Visualization and Reporting**
5. **Key Analysis Questions**

## Materials and Methods
The dataset used in this project is collected from the YouTube API, which provides access to channel statistics, video metrics, and engagement data. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of visualization techniques to present insights effectively.

## Key Analysis Questions
- What are the key metrics for channel performance?
- How do views and engagement rates change over time?
- What patterns can be identified in upload schedules?
- How does subscriber growth correlate with video performance?

Additionally, we will conduct visual analyses to enhance the understanding of audience behavior and content effectiveness.

## Libraries Used
1. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
2. **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
3. **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
4. **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
5. **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
6. **Google API Client**: For accessing the YouTube API.
7. **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YouTube-Channel-Detailed-Analytics.git
   cd YouTube-Channel-Detailed-Analytics
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the libraries individually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly google-api-python-client python-dotenv
   ```

## YouTube API Key Setup
To access the YouTube API, you will need a valid API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.

2. **Enable the YouTube Data API**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "API & Services" dashboard.
   - Click on "Enable APIs and Services" and search for "YouTube Data API v3".
   - Enable the API for your project.

3. **Create Credentials**:
   - Go to the "Credentials" tab in the API & Services dashboard.
   - Click on "Create Credentials" and select "API Key".
   - Copy the generated API key.

4. **Store the API Key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file:
     ```
     YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into YouTube channel performance, enabling content creators and marketers to implement effective strategies and improve their audience engagement.
